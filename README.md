# Overview

This project is based on an assignment in my Intro to Object Oriented Design class using Java. 
It started as a Tetris-like game, but I adapted it to play as the original Tetris.

Most of the original source code (gui and api) was designed by my professor. 
Everything in the hw4 folder is what I created. I also edited a few lines in ui/GameMain.java
and ui/PlayLevel.java to get the game to play correctly.
